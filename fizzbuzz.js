* Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions.

* When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5
* (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
